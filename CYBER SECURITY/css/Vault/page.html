        <li style="color:lightgreen;" >HACKING</li>is the act of compromising digital devices and networks 
        through unauthorized access to an account or computer system. Hacking is not always a malicious act,
         but it is most commonly associated with illegal activity and data theft by cyber criminals.

            <i>
                Passwords are the most widespread method of authenticating access to a secure information
                 system, making them an attractive target for cyber attackers. By accessing a person’s password,
                 an attacker can gain entry to confidential or critical data and systems, including the ability 
                 to manipulate and control said data/systems.

            <i>
                Password attackers use a myriad of methods to identify an individual password, including
                 using social engineering, gaining access to a password database, testing the network connection
                  to obtain unencrypted passwords, or simply by guessing.

        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                The last method mentioned is executed in a systematic manner known as a “brute-force attack.” 
                A brute-force attack employs a program to try all the possible variants and combinations of 
                information to guess the password.

            <i>
                Another common method is the dictionary attack, when the attacker uses a list of common 
                passwords to attempt to gain access to a user’s computer and network. Account lockout best
                 practices and two-factor authentication are very useful at preventing a password attack.
                  Account lockout features can freeze the account out after a number of invalid password 
                  attempts and two-factor authentication adds an additional layer of security, requiring 
                  the user logging in to enter a secondary code only available on their 2FA device(s).
