                <i class="state_3_12">Building the right team</i>
                We believe in the Pareto Principle as the principle of factor sparsity which states that 20% of your employees <br>
                will demand 80% of your time as the company's leader. The concept has a name for a reason- it's a real <br> 
                problem that thousands of company presidents and CEOs face each day. If you fall into this trap at your <br> 
                company, you'll almost certainly fail to reach your goals. To prevent such a dire situation, you need a Human <br> 
                Resources team that is experienced in sourcing and recruiting qualified candidates who are a good fit for <br> 
                your company. We believe in capacity building of employees by upskilling or reskilling. The life span <br> 
                of skills is less than 5 years now, and the answer lies in building a strategies around continuously <br> 
                upskilling and reskilling your workforce to bridge skill gaps efficiently and attune them to evolving <br> 
                jobs and business needs. Ideathon is another way to go. It not only guarantees innovation but guarantees <br> 
                innovation at speed, precisely what the world of business NEEDS right now. Also, for organizations <br> 
                that wish to invest in employee engagement, ideathons are the sure- shot way to get the ball rolling. <br><br>

                We believe that human resource is the cornerstone of any organization and any success is depended on <br> 
                the vibrancy of the workforce retained. Getting the right people and ensuring that they have the <br> 
                necessary skills is essential for business success. The workforce is the organization's greatest <br> 
                resource and this gives the tagging line for any organization to achieve its ideas and hit its <br> 
                business goals. The workforce plays a significant role in developing positive business culture <br> 
                and improving employee engagement, productivity, wellness and personal development. <br><br>

                    <h2>Staff Outsourcing</h2>
                    Our core competence in staff outsourcing is getting the right people for the right work without <br> 
                    necessarily creating unnecessary demand to the organization but creating room and synergies to <br> 
                    concentrate on more business and profit oriented interventions. We believe workforce outsourcing <br> 
                    is an essential enabler for small, medium and corporate enterprises to direct internal resources <br> 
                    to most critical core functions for continued business growth. Outsourcing your Human Resource <br> 
                    Administrative processes though our company we become the responsible party for Human Resource <br> 
                    administration and relieve you to optimize your human capital. <br>
                    <h2>Recruitment Services and onboarding</h2>
                    Our recruitment processes are guided by professional recruitment and employment guidelines. <br> 
                    Recruiting for a single role, whatever the level, can be a costly and time-consuming process <br> 
                    for any organization and with no guaranteed success. In a dynamic market environment, where <br> 
                    employers are competing with each other for the most competent talent at all levels, this <br> 
                    becomes even more challenging. Our clients will only spare time to make the selection decision,<br>
                    saving you dozens of business hours that you can invest for strategic business functions. We <br> 
                    listen to your needs, get to know your business and understand your detailed business strategy and <br> 
                    vision. <br>
                    <h2>Interim Integration Management</h2>
                    We advocate for integrating Interim Managers to offer businesses a competitive advantage due to their <br> 
                    flexibility and invaluable injection of expertise within a short notice. These managers are hired for <br> 
                    a short period of time to support and strengthen management on full time, but on a temporary basis. They are <br>
                    normally senior executives capable of driving transformative management interventions, crisis management, <br> 
                    corporate restructuring or unexpected critical exits. Interim executives identify the problem, provide <br> 
                    the solution, drive the implementation as they train internal resources, then exit after takeoff and <br> 
                    stabilization stage. <br>

                        <p>
                            <h3>Competency</h3>
                            Interim Managers are C-Suite level or Very Senior Level executives who have expertise <br> in a broad range 
                            of business functions including Finance, Research and Development, <br> Human Resources, Legal and Management  
                            among other critical business functions. <br> They give you the opportunity to access the skills of a highly experienced  
                            executive <br> who is able to quickly understand the prevailing business challenges you have, <br> and apply their expansive prior 
                            experience to quickly find practical solutions to <br> your challenges.
                            <h3>Availability</h3>
                            Compared to the time taken to hire a permanent executive, <br> where the executive search process
                            would take between 3 to 6 months, Interim Managers <br> are available when and where you need them.
                            <h3>Reliability</h3>
                            Interim Managers  are results <br> oriented and accustomed to working with specific time bound goals
                            and objectives. <br> Immediately they understand the business challenges and throughput required <br> of them to deliver
                            expected outcomes, they work to fast track the delivery <br> of tangible outcomes within the timelines committed to the project.
                            <h3>Optimization</h3>
                            Permanent Executives tend to be generously compensated as their package <br>
                            includes bonuses, health coverage, holiday pay, pension, housing, company car <br>
                            benefits among other fringe benefits. The real cost to the business can <br> become a burden.
                            <h3>Impartiality</h3>
                            Interim managers are objective and provide a fresh perspective by bringing <br>
                            in independent views. Unburdened with pre-existing relationships, office <br> 
                            politics, or career advancement goals, they are critical in injecting fresh <br> 
                            morale to the team as they get the job done before they move on after <br> 
                            delivery of results-driven solutions.

                    <h2>Executive Search</h2>
                    The success of any organization and the achievement of business goals and objectives <br> 
                    is greatly influenced by the quality of leadership executives retained. However, talented <br> 
                    professionals are in extremely high demand today, with every employer seeking to <br> 
                    attract and retain the same talent pool. When it comes to Executive Search, the <br> 
                    wrong hiring decision can be extremely expensive. Executive Search is the most <br> 
                    effective strategy for attracting Senior Management and Business Leaders. <br> 
                    Our department has invested in scientifically tested search assessment strategies <br> 
                    critical in identifying levels of competencies in executive candidates. Our thorough <br> 
                    and highly professional approach to Executive Search ensures that our clients only <br> 
                    get to appoint the most suitable candidate for the role; candidates with the right <br> 
                    personalities to support our clients' corporate strategy, organizational culture and <br> 
                    business values.
                    <h2>Payroll and Tax administration</h2>
                    Whatever your company size, payroll and tax processing can interrupt your focus and workflow. <br> 
                    We offer Payroll Management services that take care of the payroll processing and payroll <br> 
                    statutory remittances only while the client retains the Human Resource function responsibilities. <br><br>

                    within country payroll tax legislation in every country of service delivery. <br>

                    <h2>Performance management, Training and Development</h2>
                    Our training programs are soft-skills-oriented and designed to drive employee productivity. <br> 
                    The training objective is to equip employees with people skills, social and communication <br> 
                    skills, character and personality skills as well as emotional intelligence quotients <br> 
                    among other critical productivity enablers. We don't just tell people what they need to <br> 
                    do to change; rather we help them realize the need for them to change from inside and this <br> 
                    ensures lasting transformation that sustains productivity. Our programs are highly customized <br> 
                    and innovative pedagogical approaches to address the unique business challenges of every client <br> 
                    and anchored on the premise that you can't teach adults. For this reason, our experienced trainers <br> 
                    approach training in a purely experiential way, allowing participants to discover their own solutions <br> 
                    to their challenges.
                    <h2>Elite Tailored Psychometric Assessment tools</h2>
                    Psychometric tests offer insights into the factors that influence a person's performance in the <br> 
                    workplace, hence a critical tool in staff selection, development, coaching and teambuilding. Psychometric <br>
                    Assessments are scientifically proven to measure an individual's capabilities and behavioural styles. They <br> 
                    can measure different personality traits, which helps with the identification and development of <br> 
                    talent. Psychometric Tests provide the employer with a method of selecting the most suitable job <br> 
                    applicants, thus serving to effectively support the recruitment and selection process. Research has <br> 
                    shown that soundly developed psychometric tests greatly enhance the recruitment process by providing <br> 
                    evidence of ability or potential in a particular area that helps make a well-informed decision on a <br> 
                    candidates' suitability for a particular role.
                    <h2>Expatriate Engagement</h2>
                    With Africa's economy projected to grow, this is the right time for international companies to expand <br> 
                    their business into the African continent. However, this in itself is both an exciting and challenging <br> 
                    endeavor
                    <h2>Staff retention</h2>
                    Given that we spend more than a third of our lifetimes in the workplace, it is important employees <br> 
                    feel happy and connected in the place they work. If they don't, then you have a staff retention <br> 
                    problem on your hands, or at the very least you will encounter issues of presenteeism and absenteeism. <br> 
                    Culture fit is the most important aspect of retaining employees. Employees that don't mesh well with the <br> 
                    values of your organization won't be satisfied in their jobs and have the potential to create a toxic work <br> 
                    environment and are more likely to leave.
                    <h2>Culture-fit hiring (Building and maintaining company culture)</h2>
                    We believe in Culture-fit hiring which recognizes the importance of hiring people who have the <br> 
                    personality and business attributes to match the values, beliefs and attitudes upheld in their organization. <br> 
                    Culture-fit hiring is all about ensuring congruence between the candidate and the values and norms of the <br> 
                    business. A company's culture can be seen as the values and beliefs of the company's founders through to <br> 
                    the collective force of employees, interactions between management and staff, and the environment in <br> 
                    which they work. It's a bit like an ecosystem involving a complex network of organisms and components, <br> 
                    which includes us (humans), and the technology, systems, premises, tools etc. which we need to work.
                    <h2>Strategic Management</h2>
                    We believe strategic management is an important aspect of any organization and plays a vital role in <br> 
                    human resource management. Human Resource managers manage strategies to ensure the organization reaches <br> 
                    its business goals, as well as contributing significantly to the corporate decision- making process, <br> 
                    which includes assessments for current employees and predictions for future ones based on business demands. <br>
                    <h2>Organizational Communication</h2>
                    We believe in open communication. When values are aligned, employees naturally find it easier to communicate. <br> 
                    Company culture is a powerful driver of business success. It is the key to employee engagement, performance <br> 
                    and productivity. Employees who identify more with their company are happier, experience greater job satisfaction, <br> 
                    are more committed, perform better and are more likely to stay with their organization. Businesses require <br> 
                    effective communication to operate well. Good <br>
                    communication mitigates misunderstandings, increases employee engagement, forms the basis for better client <br> 
                    relationships, encourages innovation and creativity and helps build a positive culture.
                    <h2>Employee Compensation, Benefits and Cohesiveness</h2>
                    Our managers understand the noble role in compensation and benefits. They are responsible for devising <br> 
                    compensation strategies, performance management systems and compensation structures, as well as negotiating <br> 
                    pay and benefit packages with potential employees. <br><br>
                    Our Human Resource managers work towards reducing costs in recruitment and retention. Our professionals <br> 
                    are trained to conduct efficient negotiations with potential and existing employees, as well as <br> 
                    being well-versed with employee benefits that are likely to attract quality candidates and retaining <br> 
                    the existing workforce. We are responsible for conducting activities, events and celebrations in the <br> 
                    organization which gives way to team building opportunities. Moreover, it enhances interactivity within <br> 
                    employees and instils a sense of trust and respect among peers.
                    <h2>Conflict management</h2>
                    Our department ensure that issues and conflicts are resolved effectively, approaching the problem with an <br> 
                    unbiased attitude and encouraging effective communication to reach a solution and/or employing alternative <br> 
                    dispute resolution mechanisms. In addition, they help employees understand various ways of developing <br> 
                    effective work relationships and the importance of not letting personal judgement affect <br>
                    their behaviour.
                    <h2>Legal and Regulatory compliance</h2>
                    Our HR professionals have a full understanding of employment law and the regulatory requirements of a <br> 
                    business associated with staff. This enormous area shouldn't be underestimated; an unfair dismissal claim <br> 
                    can be an expensive mistake. The complexities of employment law aren't effective time management, and it's <br> 
                    costly for the business when something goes wrong. Outsourcing your HR needs lets business leaders <br> 
                    concentrate on growing their business. Having someone to look after employee-related matters, from <br> 
                    absence management through parental leave policies and beyond, will keep your business compliant and <br> 
                    your employees more engaged. HR management helps bridge the gap between employees' performance <br> 
                    and the organization's strategic objectives. HR professionals work towards making the organization <br> 
                    compliant with employment laws, as well as maintaining records of hiring processes and <br> 
                    applicants' log. HR is a critical business function that helps companies succeed in hiring <br> 
                    employees, keeping them engaged, and supporting their growth and development. <br><br>

                    Our team recognizes safety as an important aspect for any organization in minimizing risks to <br> 
                    staff and those we service is always a high priority. During the last several years, safety <br> 
                    and compliance tracking have taken on an entirely new light for the contract service provider, <br> 
                    as it now directly influences both acquiring and retaining clients. We ensure increased awareness <br> 
                    of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and its relationship to cost reduction.
